# Progress

Updated by every coding session. Read this after `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PLAN-PHASE-2.md` and `docs/PLAN-PHASE-3.md`, and continue from the first unchecked item.

**Current phase:** Phase 3 (Kindness score, profiles, chat and reviews). 3A–3D are done and 3E is done except for the steps that need a person on a Mac. Phase 2 is complete (`v0.2.0-ui`), Phase 1 is complete (`v0.1.0-prototype`)
**Next task:** The owner works through "Needs the owner's review" below: fast-forward `main` to `claude/brave-cray-shr7y8`, run the Phase 3 demo by hand, check the Phase 3 screenshots, then tag `v0.3.0-profiles`. Still open for a person: run the demo script in the README by hand once, in light and in dark mode, and look over the final screenshots in `docs/screenshots/phase-2/`

## Phase checklist

- [x] **1A.** Repo scaffold and empty app
- [x] **1B.** Core domain (models, protocols, rules, distance)
- [x] **1C.** Mock data layer (repository, location, session, seed data)
- [x] **1D.** App environment and navigation shell (tabs, Dev Settings)
- [x] **1E.** Browse nearby + request detail + pick up (Flow 2)
- [x] **1F.** Post request + My Activity (Flow 1)
- [x] **1G.** Hardening, UI test, docs, tag `v0.1.0-prototype`

Phase 2, UI refresh ([PLAN-PHASE-2.md](PLAN-PHASE-2.md)):

- [x] **2A.** Theme and shared components, "before" screenshots
- [x] **2B.** Nearby and Request Detail, then the review gate
- [x] **2C.** Post, My Activity and Dev Settings
- [x] **2D.** Polish, app icon, docs, tag `v0.2.0-ui`

Phase 3, Kindness score, profiles, chat and reviews ([PLAN-PHASE-3.md](PLAN-PHASE-3.md)):

- [x] **3A.** Kindness score: core and data (rules, repository, seed history)
- [x] **3B.** Profile tab with score and gift card (screenshots not yet checked by eye)
- [x] **3C.** Chat between requester and helper
- [x] **3D.** Reviews
- [ ] **3E.** Hardening, demo, docs, tag `v0.3.0-profiles` (everything but the by-eye checks and the tag; see "Needs the owner's review")

## Needs the owner's review

Phase 3 was built in one cloud session with no Mac (see the 2026-10-09 session log). Everything below is waiting on a person.

**To finish 3E**

1. Bring the work into `main`: `git checkout main && git pull && git merge --ff-only origin/claude/brave-cray-shr7y8 && git push`. The session could push only its own branch, so `main` was not moved and the branch was not renamed to `phase/3*`.
2. Run the Phase 3 demo script in the README by hand, in light and in dark mode, and listen to the new rows with VoiceOver once (message bubbles, reviews, profile activities).
3. Look at the Phase 3 screenshots in light, dark, `accessibility-large` and `accessibility-largest` (the commit recording this list was pushed with `[screenshots]`, so the "Manual checks" run for it on GitHub Actions has a `screenshots` artifact with all four sets; or regenerate them with the `ScreenshotUITests` command in the README). Commit the light, dark and `accessibility-large` sets to `docs/screenshots/phase-3/` and pick README images if you want any.
4. Tag `v0.3.0-profiles` on the commit you are happy with and push the tag.

**Judgment calls to confirm or change** (each is also in the decision log)

- Gift card above 100 points reads "110 of 100 points" with a full bar, not "100 of 100". Nothing is hidden, but it looks odd.
- The gift card says "Every 100 points earns a $5 gift card." The $5 is the plan's placeholder.
- Avatar colors: Alex blue, Bea indigo, Chen green, Dana pink (from the five colorful palette entries by a fixed hash of the user ID).
- The chat thread stays readable after completion or cancellation, read-only, with a lock note. Sending after completion throws `notAllowed`, not a new error.
- Message and Leave a review buttons: Message is a tinted (secondary) button, Leave a review is a filled (primary) one, both on Request Detail above Mark completed and Cancel.
- Someone's own profile, reached from Request Detail, shows their gift card, the same as the Profile tab.
- The review on Request Detail is shown to everyone who opens the request, titled "Your review" for its author and "Review" for anyone else.
- Profile past activities show completed requests only on every profile, including your own; open and claimed ones stay in My Activity.
- The Request Detail requester and helper rows are now tappable and show the score; VoiceOver still reads "Posted by, Bea" and adds the score as a hint.


## Commit map

One row per commit, oldest first, grouped by phase. Every session adds its commits here before it ends, so this table and `git log` stay in step.

- Each phase ends with a `docs: record phase <id> progress` commit. That commit cannot list its own hash before it exists, so the next commit to touch this file fills it in.
- To undo a whole phase, revert its range, newest phase first: `git revert --no-commit <first>^..<last>`, then commit.
- To undo one change, `git revert <hash>`. Later phases build on earlier ones, so expect conflicts when reverting anything but the newest work.

- Bundle identifier: `edu.cornelltech.team402.favorly`
- Minimum iOS: 17
- Default fake location: Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island (40.7553, -73.9562)
- Categories: Ingredient, Moving help, Car help, Errand, Other
- Units: miles in the UI, meters internally

## Decisions made during implementation

Add entries as `YYYY-MM-DD · phase · decision · reason`.

- 2026-10-07 · 1A · The `Favorly` scheme's test action lists the three package test targets and `FavorlyUITests` directly, with no `.xctestplan` file · a test plan file refers to project targets by generated IDs, which would be hand-maintained against a git-ignored project; the scheme runs the same tests
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Optional GitHub Actions CI left out · it could not be verified from this machine, and the hosted runner's Xcode and simulator names are unknown; add it once someone can watch a run
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · `FavorlyCoreModule` and `FavorlyDataModule` are placeholder types so the targets compile and have one trivial test each · delete them in 1B and 1C when real types land
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Only folders that hold a file exist so far (`Root/` in Features) · git does not track empty folders; each later phase creates the plan's folders as it fills them
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · SwiftFormat rule `wrapPropertyBodies` disabled · the plan's own code uses one-line computed properties (`var id: RequestID { request.id }`)
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · SwiftLint `trailing_comma` set to mandatory · otherwise it conflicts with SwiftFormat, which adds trailing commas
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · UI test target has `LaunchUITests` (app shows four tabs) · the target needs a source file; `DemoFlowUITests` arrives in 1G
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · Every public model has an explicit `public init`; `HelpRequest`'s defaults `helperID` and `claimedAt` to `nil` and `status` to `.open` · Swift's memberwise initializers are internal, so other modules could not build the types otherwise
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · `DraftValidator.validate(_:)` returns the draft with title and details trimmed (`@discardableResult`), where the plan shows no return value · the repository must store the trimmed title, and this keeps the trimming in one place
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · Details are trimmed before the 500-character check, like the title · the plan only says "0–500 characters"; trailing whitespace should not use up the limit
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · `validateClaim` checks "own request" before status, so a requester claiming their own already-claimed request gets `cannotClaimOwnRequest` · the plan does not order the two checks
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · `DistanceFormatter.miles` shows "< 0.1 mi" for anything under 0.1 mi, including 0.05–0.1 mi that would round up to "0.1 mi" · the plan's wording allows either; this one never overstates a short distance
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · Added `Distance.metersPerMile`, `Distance.meters(fromMiles:)`, `DraftValidator.titleLengthRange` and `DraftValidator.maxDetailsLength` · the UI needs the same constants for the radius picker and form hints
- 2026-10-07 · 1B · SwiftLint `identifier_name` allows `to` · the plan names the parameter in `canTransition(from:to:)`
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `LocationSettings` is a `@MainActor` protocol in Core, with `LocationPreset` as a Core model; the `@Observable` class is `MockLocationSettings` in Data · the plan puts `LocationSettings` in Data but has `AppEnvironment` (Features) hold it, and Features must not import Data. This mirrors `SessionStore` / `MockSessionStore`
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · Seed data is `DemoRequests.all(now:)`, a function, where the plan writes `DemoRequests.all` · timestamps are relative to launch time, and tests need a fixed clock
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `MockRequestRepository.init` takes `seed`, `artificialDelay` and `now` closures/values, all defaulted · tests run with zero delay and a fixed clock; 1G's `-uiTesting` launch argument will pass zero delay
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `reset()` skips the artificial delay and emits on `changes()` · it is a dev-settings action, and open screens must refresh after it
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `requests(claimedBy:)` returns every request whose helper is the user, whatever its status, newest claim first · "Picked up by me" should keep showing completed and cancelled pick-ups
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `changes()` streams buffer one pending signal · the signal has no payload, so a slow subscriber needs only one refresh
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · `FavorlyData` imports `os` (for `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` in `ChangeBroadcaster`) and `Observation` · `changes()` is not `async`, so the actor needs a lock-protected subscriber list; both are system frameworks
- 2026-10-07 · 1C · Seed has 12 requests: from Cornell Tech, 3 open within 0.25 mi, 7 within 1 mi, 8 within 3 mi · matches the plan's "about 8" for the demo and makes each radius step visibly change the list
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · `SessionStore` and `LocationSettings` now also require `Sendable` · `AppEnvironment` must be `Sendable` to be an environment default and to be captured by view-model tasks; `@MainActor` classes already are, so conformers need no change
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · The environment value uses SwiftUI's `@Entry` macro (`EnvironmentValues.appEnvironment`), where the plan says `EnvironmentKey` · `@Entry` generates the same key; SwiftFormat rewrites a hand-written key to it
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · `AppEnvironment.preview()` is built from small read-only stubs inside Features (`PreviewRequestRepository`, `PreviewLocationProvider`, `PreviewSessionStore`, `PreviewLocationSettings`) · Features cannot import Data, and previews and the environment default still need something to run on
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · A view with no injected environment gets `AppEnvironment.sharedPreview` through `MainActor.assumeIsolated` · the default must be produced from a nonisolated context; SwiftUI reads environment values on the main actor. The app always injects `AppEnvironment.demo()`
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · `FavorlyFeaturesTests` depends on `FavorlyData` · the plan calls for view model tests against the mocks; only the Features sources are barred from importing Data
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · Dev Settings lists users and locations as rows of buttons with a checkmark, not `Picker`s · each row gets a stable `accessibilityIdentifier` the UI tests can tap
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · No Dev Settings view model · the screen only forwards taps to the session, location settings and repository, and holds no logic to test; `DevSettingsUITests` covers it end to end
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · "Reset demo data" restores requests only, not the current user or location · the plan lists it under data controls
- 2026-10-07 · 1D · The debug line reads "Alex @ Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island", using the full location label, where the plan's example shows "Alex @ Cornell Tech" · the label is the plan's own preset name
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · View models take the `AppEnvironment` in `init`; `RootView` reads it from the SwiftUI environment and passes it down · a view model has to exist before the view body runs, so it cannot read `@Environment` itself
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · Location and radius changes reload through `.task(id: viewModel.reloadKey)` in the view; repository writes reload through `viewModel.observeChanges()` · the plan says the view model "observes" both; this keeps the view model free of observation plumbing and easy to test
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · A list already on screen stays visible while it reloads; only the first load and a retry after an error show the spinner · avoids a flicker on every radius tap and every write
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · Nearby keeps the debug line ("Alex @ Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island") as its location header, and shows a count ("7 requests") above the list · on one laptop the demo needs to show who is signed in; the count makes radius changes obvious and gives UI tests something stable to read
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · The detail status row reads "Claimed by Bea" while claimed, with a separate Helper row for claimed and completed requests · matches the demo script's wording
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · Only Pick up asks for confirmation; Cancel request and Mark completed act at once · the plan asks for a dialog before Pick up only
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · When an action fails, the detail screen shows the message and reloads the request · after `alreadyClaimed` the user should see who claimed it
- 2026-10-07 · 1E · Added `BrowseAndPickUpUITests` (Flow 2, own request has no Pick up, empty and error states) · the plan checks Flow 2 by hand; an agent cannot, so the flow is automated
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · `RootView` owns the tab selection and the just-posted request ID; `PostRequestView` reports a post through an `onPosted` closure · switching tabs and highlighting are navigation concerns, so the Post view model stays unaware of other tabs
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · The new request is highlighted in My Activity (tinted row and a "New" badge) until the user leaves that tab · the plan says "highlight" without saying for how long
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · The Post form's category defaults to Other · none of the five is an obvious default, and the demo picks Ingredient explicitly
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · The title message appears only once the user has typed something; the Post button is disabled either way · an empty form should not open with an error
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · My Activity rows show the status ("Claimed by Bea"), plus "Posted by Dana" for requests picked up from someone else · the plan lists "status and helper" for My requests and nothing for Picked up by me
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · `statusText(for:)` moved to a `SessionStore` extension shared by Request Detail and My Activity · both screens need the same "Claimed by Bea" wording
- 2026-10-07 · 1F · Added `PostAndGetPickedUpUITests` (Flow 1 end to end, and the two empty states) · the plan checks Flow 1 by hand; 1G turns this into `DemoFlowUITests`
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · `-uiTesting` only sets the mock delay to zero · the plan also says it "resets data", but data is in memory and every launch already starts from the seed
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · `DemoFlowUITests` runs the whole seven-step demo script, which contains Flow 1; it replaces 1F's `PostAndGetPickedUpUITests` · one test that mirrors the README script is easier to keep in step with it
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · UI tests share a `UITestCase` base class (launch, lookup by identifier, wait, scroll-then-tap) · removes the duplicated helpers noted in 1F
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · List rows speak one sentence to VoiceOver ("Need 2 eggs for a cake, Ingredient, less than 0.1 miles away, posted 12 minutes ago by Chen"); detail rows read as label plus value · the default reading split each row into fragments and read "<" literally. Added `DistanceFormatter.spokenMiles` in Core for this
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · Detail rows stack the value under the label at accessibility text sizes, and row icons scale with the text · side-by-side text was cramped at large sizes
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · Dev Settings rows use primary text color, not the button tint · every row looked like a link
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · `ScreenshotUITests` regenerates the README screenshots and is skipped unless `TEST_RUNNER_SCREENSHOT_DIR` is set · an agent cannot tap through the Simulator by hand to capture them
- 2026-10-07 · 1G · Tag `v0.1.0-prototype` points at the tip of `phase/1g-hardening`, because the phase pull requests were not merged yet · if the pull requests are squash-merged, move the tag to the resulting commit on `main`
- 2026-10-07 · post-1G · No pull requests: `main` was fast-forwarded to `phase/1g-hardening`, keeping every commit · the owner decided no review step is needed; the tag `v0.1.0-prototype` stays valid because no commit was rewritten
- 2026-10-07 · post-1G · Added the "Commit map" section, one row per commit · the owner wants the progress file and the commit history to match, so changes are easy to trace and revert
- 2026-10-07 · Phase 2 plan · The Phase 2 plan is its own file, `docs/PLAN-PHASE-2.md`; `docs/PLAN.md` stays the source of truth for architecture and behavior · the Phase 1 plan is a finished record, and Phase 2 changes looks only
- 2026-10-07 · Phase 2 plan · Phase 2 keeps one branch per phase but has no pull requests: fast-forward `main` at the end of each phase, then delete the branch · follows the owner's decision for Phase 1
- 2026-10-07 · Phase 2 plan · "Functionality unchanged" is defined as: no edits to Core, Data, view models, identifiers, visible strings, control types, or the four behavior UI test classes · gives each phase something concrete to check
- 2026-10-07 · Phase 2 plan · Theme colors are light and dark hex pairs in code, not an asset catalog in the package or system colors · they can be unit tested for contrast, and `swift test` on macOS does not compile asset catalogs
- 2026-10-07 · Phase 2 plan · Brand color defaults to teal (`#0A6B67` light, `#4FD1C5` dark); the owner has not confirmed it · it can be changed in one place before or at the 2B review gate
- 2026-10-08 · CI · Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `swift test` and the full `xcodebuild test` on every push to `main`, `phase/**` and `ci/**` · the owner asked for the full test run; the repo is public, so standard macOS runners are free
- 2026-10-08 · CI · CI runs on `macos-26` with its default Xcode (26.6, iOS 26.5 simulator), while local development uses Xcode 27 and iOS 27 · the `xcode-27` runner label is still in public preview; the code builds and passes on both, so CI also guards against relying on the newest SDK
- 2026-10-08 · CI · The workflow picks the first iPhone on the newest installed iOS runtime, not a named device · simulator names differ between runner images
- 2026-10-08 · CI · UI test waits went from 5 s to a shared 20 s (`UITestCase.waitTimeout`), and `waitFor` now accepts any element with the identifier · the hosted runner is several times slower, and on iOS 26.5 a `Label`'s icon and text share one identifier, so the first match was the icon. No assertion changed
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · `ScreenshotUITests` has one test per appearance and writes `<screen>-light.png` and `<screen>-dark.png` for the five screens and the Nearby empty state; it switches appearance with `XCUIDevice.shared.appearance` and sets it back to light afterwards · no app code is needed to force a color scheme
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · The "before" set is in `docs/screenshots/phase-1/` (12 images, iPhone 17, iOS 27.0); the three README images in `docs/screenshots/` are untouched until 2D · take the Phase 2 screenshots on the same simulator so they compare side by side
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · Added `Theme.Colors.onBrand` (white in light mode, black in dark mode) for the primary button label · the component table says "white label", but the 2A test list asks for black on the dark brand color, and white on `#4FD1C5` would not be readable
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · Added `Theme.IconSize` (`row` 36, `large` 56), `Theme.pressedOpacity` (0.7) and `Theme.disabledOpacity` (0.4), and `Theme.Colors.palette` listing the nine tokens · components need these numbers and no literal should live outside `Theme`; the contrast test loops over `palette`
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · `RGBColor` has `blended(over:opacity:)`, and `AdaptiveColor` has `rgb(for:)` · the contrast test needs the color of a 14% tint on a background, without SwiftUI
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · `StatusBadge` and `TagBadge` are rounded rectangles with `Theme.Radius.badge`, not true capsules · the plan says "capsule" but also defines a badge radius of 6; a rounded rectangle still looks right when "Claimed by Bea" wraps at accessibility text sizes. Change at the review gate if a pill is preferred
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · `MessageView` takes the accessibility identifiers for its message and Retry button as parameters, and Retry uses the system `.bordered` style · `nearby.empty`, `nearby.error` and `nearby.retry` must stay on the same kind of element
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · Fact symbols in `FactRow` are gray, not brand colored · the brand color marks what the user can act on, and facts are not tappable
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · Shared components live in `Shared/Components/`, with a `LightAndDarkPreview` helper that shows preview content in both modes · keeps each component's `#Preview` to one block
- 2026-10-08 · 2A · Tests that import SwiftUI refer to `FavorlyFeatures.RGBColor` through a type alias · macOS has an old system type also named `RGBColor`
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · Each Request Detail action is its own list section with compact spacing, and the buttons have 16 pt vertical padding · on iOS 26 a list section clips its rows to the card shape; a shorter button, or two buttons in one row, came out with uneven corners. This way every button has the same corners as the cards above it, and `Theme.Radius.button` only shows outside a list
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · Added `plainListRow()` (no card, no insets, no separator) and `compactSectionSpacing()` (iOS only) as shared view helpers · screens need them for full-width buttons and centered messages, and the clear color and the `#if os(iOS)` should not live in screen files
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · Empty, error and loading states on Nearby and Request Detail sit on the page background, not in a card · matches the system's own empty states
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · The status badge in the Request Detail header is hidden from VoiceOver · the Status row below already speaks the same text, and spoken output must not change
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · The Request Detail load error also uses `MessageView` (`exclamationmark.triangle`) · the plan lists symbols only for Nearby; same treatment keeps the two screens consistent
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · Request Detail uses `toolbarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)` · it exists on macOS too, so `swift test` still builds the package
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · `ScreenshotUITests` has a third test at the `accessibility-large` text size (launch argument `-UIPreferredContentSizeCategoryName`), and also captures Nearby with a "Yours" row, the Nearby error state, and Request Detail with Pick up and with the requester's two buttons · the plan asks for a by-eye check at that size and those states were not in the first set
- 2026-10-08 · 2B · Phase 2 screenshots are in `docs/screenshots/phase-2/` (21 images for Nearby and Request Detail) · next to `phase-1/` for the review gate
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · The highlighted new row uses `Theme.highlightOpacity` (0.08), not the 0.14 tint, drawn by `HighlightedRowBackground` over the plain background · at 0.14 the "Open" and "New" badges on top of it fell to about 4.2:1; at 0.08 every palette color stays above 4.5:1, and a test checks it. In dark mode the highlighted row is a little darker than a normal row, because the shared background style is black there
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · `ActivityRow` splits the view model's subtitle ("Claimed by Bea · Posted by Dana") at " · " to show the status as a badge and the rest as gray text · the view model must not change in Phase 2. The spoken label is built from the unsplit subtitle, as before
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · In `ActivityRow` the badge and "Posted by" text sit side by side when they fit and stack when they do not (`ViewThatFits`) · they overflow at accessibility text sizes
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · Added `SectionHeader` (Post headers and the Nearby count) and `InlineMessage` (red text with a warning symbol, for validation, submit and location errors on Post) as shared components · the same styling was needed in several places
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · The Post submit error is its own section above the button, and the Category section has no header · the button row has no card, so the error needs one; adding a "Category" header would add a visible string
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · Dev Settings keeps the system section headers and its footer; only the checkmarks (brand color, semibold) and the Reset button changed · the plan asks for it to stay the plainest screen
- 2026-10-08 · 2C · `docs/screenshots/phase-2/` now holds the full set: 16 captures in light, dark and `accessibility-large` (48 images, 11 MB) · replaces the 2B subset
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · Consistency pass: the Request Detail error banner became the shared `ErrorBanner`, `FactRow`'s stacked spacing uses `Theme.Spacing.small` (4, was a literal 2), and the icon's symbol size uses the new `Theme.IconSize.symbolScale` (0.5) · no screen file now holds a shape, a color or a number for style. System colors (`.primary`, `.secondary`) stay, as the plan allows
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · `CategoryIcon` grows with text size only up to `Theme.IconSize.maxScale` (2×) · at the largest accessibility size the icon took so much of the row that titles broke one word per line. The `accessibility-large` look is unchanged, since it is just under the cap
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · At accessibility text sizes the "Yours" and "New" badges sit under the row's text, not beside it, and My Activity always stacks its status line · beside the text they squeezed the title into mid-word breaks ("Nee/d a"). Spoken labels and identifiers are unchanged
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · `StatusBadge` text always wraps and is never cut off · "Claimed by Bea" was truncated to "Claime…" at the largest text size
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · `ScreenshotUITests` has a fourth test at the largest text size (`accessibility-largest`, `AccessibilityXXXL`); it scrolls to rows that are off screen at that size and no longer requires elements that sit below the fold · the plan asks for every screen at the largest size. Those 16 images were checked by eye and are not committed, to keep the repo small
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency were checked by running the light screenshot test with the simulator setting on (`xcrun simctl ui <device> increase_contrast enabled`; `defaults write com.apple.Accessibility EnhancedBackgroundContrastEnabled` inside the simulator) · nothing clipped, overlapped or lost its meaning. Theme colors do not change with Increase Contrast; they already pass 4.5:1, and system text and bars adapt on their own
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · The app icon is `hand.raised.fill` in white, 56% of the icon's height, on the light brand color, drawn by `scripts/make-app-icon.swift` with AppKit; one 1024×1024 image with no transparency, no separate dark or tinted variants · the plan asks for a script so it can be redrawn; the system derives the other appearances
- 2026-10-09 · 2D · The README shows three light screenshots and one dark (Nearby), copied from `docs/screenshots/phase-2/`, which was regenerated at the end of 2D · the plan asks for light screenshots and one dark
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · The Phase 3 plan is its own file, `docs/PLAN-PHASE-3.md`, with five phases 3A–3E; Kindness score and Profile come first (3A, 3B), then chat and reviews · the owner set those two as priorities 1 and 2
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · Kindness score: 10 points to the helper per completed request plus 2 per review star; only helping earns points · owner's choice
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · Gift card: progress toward 100 points plus a fake Redeem that deducts the points and shows a reward code; the lifetime score never drops · owner's choice
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · Reviews: the requester reviews the helper, once per completed request · owner's choice
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · Profile picture: an initials avatar drawn in code, no image assets · owner's choice; keeps Phase 2's no-image-assets rule
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · New capabilities are three new Core protocols (`KindnessRepository`, `ReviewRepository`, `ChatRepository`), all implemented by the one `MockRequestRepository` actor · `RequestRepository` stays as it is, and one actor keeps cross-cutting rules atomic with one `changes()` stream and one `reset()`
- 2026-10-09 · Phase 3 plan · Five completed seed requests and seed reviews are added so Bea starts at 90 points; none involve Alex · profiles need history and the demo must reach a gift card in one favor, without changing Alex's empty states or any Nearby count
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · 3A adds only what its task list names: `Review`, `Redemption`, `KindnessSummary`, `ReviewID`, `RedemptionID`, `KindnessRepository`, and `ReviewRepository` with its two reads. `NewReviewDraft` and `submitReview` wait for 3D, `ChatMessage`, `MessageID` and `ChatRepository` for 3C · the plan splits them that way
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `KindnessRules` has `pointsPerFavor` (10), `pointsPerStar` (2), `giftCardCost` (100), `summary(completedAsHelper:reviews:redemptions:)`, `validateRedeem(_:)` and `rewardCode(number:)` · the plan wants the values defined once; redeem validation and the code format are rules too, so they live beside them
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `summary` counts stars only from reviews of requests it counts as completed favors · a review can only exist for a completed request, but the pure function should not trust its input; it also makes a stray review in a test seed harmless
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · Reward codes count up across all users, not per user (Bea's first is `FAVORLY-0001`, the next anyone redeems is `FAVORLY-0002`), and `reset()` starts them over · a gift card code should be unique; the demo script only needs Bea's to be `FAVORLY-0001`
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `review(for:)` throws `notFound` for an unknown request and returns `nil` for a known request with no review · matches `request(id:)`
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `redemptions(by:)` is newest first by the order of redeeming, not by `createdAt` · tests use a fixed clock, so two redemptions share a time
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `MockRequestRepository`'s shared state (`requests`, `reviews`, `redemptions`, `now`, `broadcaster`, `simulateLatency()`) is internal instead of private · the plan puts each conformance in its own file, and Swift's `private` does not reach across files. It is still actor-isolated and not public
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `MockRequestRepository.init` gains `reviewSeed` (defaults to `DemoReviews.all()`), and `reset()` restores reviews and clears redemptions · tests pass a fixed clock to both seeds, as they do for requests
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · Added `DemoRequests.id(_:)` for the fixed seed IDs · `DemoReviews` needs the history requests' IDs, and tests can use it instead of building UUIDs by hand
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · History seeds 13–17 were posted 3, 4, 5, 6 and 2 days ago in the requester's own neighborhood; like every seed, they were claimed halfway between posting and now, and each review comes a few hours after its claim · "several days old" in the plan; the neighborhoods keep them believable on a profile. They are completed, so no Nearby count changes
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · `AppEnvironment` gains `kindness` and `reviews` in this phase; `chat` comes with `ChatRepository` in 3C. `AppEnvironment.demo()`, `TestWorld` and `AppEnvironmentTests` pass the one `MockRequestRepository` to all three. `PreviewRequestRepository` gains `reviews` (empty by default) and read-only conformances; its redeem throws `notAllowed` · the plan's wiring, limited to the protocols that exist so far
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · Phase 1 and 2 tests edited only for the larger seed: `DemoRequestsTests` (17 requests; the distance spread and status mix are checked on the first twelve, the Phase 1 set), `MockRequestRepositoryTests` (Chen posted 6, Chen picked up a claimed and a completed one, Bea picked up five completed ones) and `ActivityViewModelTests` (the same counts through the view model, and Bea's "Picked up by me" holds 6 after picking up the eggs). `DisplayTests` gets two new rows for the new error messages, and `AppEnvironmentTests` builds the environment with the new members · the guardrails allow edits where the plan changes what a test asserts
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · New error messages: `alreadyReviewed` → "You already reviewed this favor.", `notEnoughPoints` → "You need 100 points to redeem a gift card." (the number comes from `KindnessRules.giftCardCost`) · plain wording in the style of the existing messages
- 2026-10-09 · 3A · Worked on the session branch `claude/brave-cray-shr7y8`, not `phase/3a-kindness-core`, and did not fast-forward or push `main` · this session ran in a cloud container that may push only its assigned branch. The phase is one linear set of commits on top of `main`, so `git merge --ff-only claude/brave-cray-shr7y8` on `main` brings it in
- 2026-10-09 · 3A–3E · Phases 3B to 3E were done back to back in the same cloud session as 3A, at the owner's request ("go straight through to 3E"), instead of one phase per session · the owner was away and asked for as much as possible without waiting on review. Each phase still has its own commits and its own entries here
- 2026-10-09 · CI · `ci.yml` also runs on pushes to `claude/**` branches, and a new `manual-checks.yml` runs SwiftLint and SwiftFormat on those pushes (or by hand), plus `ScreenshotUITests` with an uploaded artifact when the commit message contains `[screenshots]` or it is run by hand with the box ticked · a cloud session has no Xcode, and GitHub only allows running a workflow by hand once it is on `main`, so pushes are how such a session builds the app and lints
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `ProfileViewModel(userID:environment:)` serves both the tab (`userID` nil, follows the signed-in user, reloads on a switch through `reloadKey`) and a pushed profile (fixed user). `isOwn` compares with the signed-in user, so your own profile opened from a request also shows the gift card · one view model and one view, as the plan's table lists
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Past activities are completed requests only, on every profile, labeled "Helped" or "Asked", newest pick-up first · the screen table says "completed requests"; rule 14 then holds for other people's profiles without a second code path
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Profile loads reviews and lists them from 3D on; in 3B the Kindness section already shows "5.0 average from 4 reviews" · the summary has the average anyway
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Gift-card progress text is "\(available) of 100 points" even above 100 ("110 of 100 points"), and the bar is capped at full · hiding points would be wrong, and the demo script's "10 of 100 points" after redeeming from 110 needs the true number. Listed for review
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `GiftCardCard` shows the code just redeemed in a tinted box ("Your reward code"), and earlier codes under "Past reward codes"; the explanation line reads "Every 100 points earns a $5 gift card." · the plan names a "$5" card as a placeholder. Listed for review
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Added `Theme.IconSize.avatar` (64) and `Theme.Colors.avatars` (brand and the four category colors). `UserID.avatarColor` picks one with a ×33 string hash of the raw ID, since Swift's `hashValue` changes between launches; the four demo users get four different colors (Alex blue, Bea indigo, Chen green, Dana pink), and `AvatarColorTests` checks it · the plan says "picked from the existing palette by a stable hash"; gray and the status colors would read as a state
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `AvatarView`, `ScoreLabel` and `GiftCardCard` live in `Shared/Components/`; `ProfileActivityRow` in `Profile/` · as the plan's table. `ScoreLabel` reads "Kindness score, 90 points" to VoiceOver, so UI tests read `profile.score` as "90 points"
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Navigation destinations moved out of `NearbyView` and `ActivityView` into one `AppDestinations` modifier that `RootView` applies to the root of each tab's stack: `RequestID` → Request Detail, `UserID` → profile · Request Detail now pushes profiles and Profile pushes Request Detail; registering each destination once avoids SwiftUI's duplicate-destination warnings deeper in a stack
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · Request Detail's "Posted by" and "Helper" rows are `NavigationLink`s to that user's profile, with a `ScoreLabel` beside the name. The rows keep their identifiers (`detail.requester`, `detail.helper`), their label and their value ("Bea", "Bea (you)"), so `BrowseAndPickUpUITests` passes unedited; the score is spoken as the hint · the plan asks for tappable names and a score beside them, and existing identifiers and spoken text must not change
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `RequestDetailViewModel` gains `requesterScore` and `helperScore`, loaded with the request and after each action; a failed lookup leaves the score out rather than failing the screen · the score is extra information
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `RootTabTests` and `LaunchUITests` now expect five tabs (`testLaunchShowsFourTabs` became `testLaunchShowsFiveTabs`) · the plan changes the tab count
- 2026-10-09 · 3B · `ScreenshotUITests` also captures `profile-empty` (Alex), `profile` (Bea) and `profile-other` (Bea's profile from Alex's request) · the plan asks for profile screenshots; they have not been looked at yet
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · `ChatRules` has `validateRead`, `validateSend`, `canRead`, `canSend`, `validateText` and `messageLengthRange` (1...500). Sending on a completed or cancelled request throws `notAllowed`, and so does reading a request with no helper · the plan names `notAllowed` for non-participants; a new error just for "closed" would need a new message for a state the UI never offers
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · A cancelled request that had a helper keeps its thread readable, like a completed one · rule 13 says the thread is read-only "after completion or cancellation"
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · The seed has no messages, and `reset()` removes every message · "restores messages to the seed"; an empty thread also shows the "Say hello" state in the demo
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · Chat opens from a "Message <name>" button (tinted, `SecondaryButtonStyle`) in its own section above Mark completed; it is shown to the requester and the helper whenever the request has a helper, so a finished thread can still be read. It pushes `ChatView` with `navigationDestination(isPresented:)` · a plain `NavigationLink` inside a list row draws a disclosure row, not a full-width button
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · `ChatView` is a plain list of `MessageBubble`s with the composer (`TextField` and a `.borderedProminent` Send button in the brand tint) pinned under it with `safeAreaInset`; it scrolls to the newest message. The composer is hidden once the thread is read-only, and a gray lock note says why. An empty closed thread says "No messages" instead of "Say hello" · the plan's states
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · `MessageBubble`: your messages on the right on a brand tint, the other person's on the left on a gray (`neutral`) tint, both in primary text, with "You · 9:41 PM" or "Bea · 9:41 PM" under them; VoiceOver reads "Bea said: On my way, at 9:41 PM". Added `Theme.Radius.bubble` (18) and `Theme.Spacing.bubbleInset` (48, the space kept free on the far side) · the plan asks for brand and neutral only; primary text on a 14% tint is at least as readable as the tested colored text
- 2026-10-09 · 3C · The composer shows a count ("9 / 500") once you type, and an inline message only when the text is too long; an empty or whitespace-only message just disables Send · same pattern as the Post form
- 2026-10-09 · 3D · `ReviewRules` has `validateReviewer(request:by:existing:)`, `canReview`, `validate(_:)` (returns the draft with the comment trimmed), `ratingRange` (1...5) and `maxCommentLength` (300). Messages: "Choose a rating from 1 to 5 stars." and "Comment must be 300 characters or fewer." · rule 12; the rating message only shows if something submits without one, since the form disables Submit
- 2026-10-09 · 3D · The review form is a sheet with its own navigation bar (Cancel on the left), a five-star picker where each star is a button (`review.star.1`…`5`), an optional comment with a count in the footer, and a full-width Submit · the plan's screen table
- 2026-10-09 · 3D · Request Detail shows the review in its own section, headed "Your review" for its author and "Review" for anyone else who opens the request; "Leave a review" is a filled button shown to the requester of a completed, unreviewed request · the plan names "Your review"; the helper and other people can already read reviews on the profile, so hiding it here would be inconsistent. Listed for review
- 2026-10-09 · 3D · The profile's Reviews section lists every review newest first with stars, comment, "Dana · Oct 9"; with none it says "No reviews yet" · plan
- 2026-10-09 · 3E · `DemoFlowUITests` keeps the Phase 1 script as it was and adds `testExtendedDemoScript` for the six Phase 3 steps; step 6 opens Bea's profile from Chen's "Water my plants for the weekend" (seed 13), a request she helped with · "extended" read as adding to it; the Phase 1 test still guards the original flow
- 2026-10-09 · 3E · Spoken sentences: activity rows "Need a pinch of saffron, Ingredient, Helped, Downtown Brooklyn"; review rows "5 out of 5 stars from Dana, Oct 9: Fast and friendly"; message bubbles "Bea said: On my way, at 9:41 PM" · the 3E accessibility task
- 2026-10-09 · 3E · `ScreenshotUITests` also captures the chat (empty and with a message), the review form (empty and filled), Request Detail with a review, and the profile's reviews: 25 captures per appearance · so the new screens can be checked by eye
- 2026-10-09 · 3E · `MARKETING_VERSION` is `0.3.0`. The tag `v0.3.0-profiles` was not created · the tag should mark a commit a person has checked by hand; see "Needs the owner's review"
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Tab bar buttons are found by label in UI tests (`app.tabBars.buttons["Nearby"]`) · SwiftUI does not reliably pass a tab item's `accessibilityIdentifier` to the tab bar button

## Known issues

- Last CI result on the session branch (commit `9e0d7e8`): `swift test` and `xcodebuild test` (iOS simulator on `macos-26`, all UI tests including `ProfileUITests`, `ChatUITests`, `ReviewUITests` and `DemoFlowUITests.testExtendedDemoScript`) pass, and SwiftLint `--strict` and `swiftformat --lint` are clean. The first runs failed on one SwiftLint rule (`function_parameter_count`), two SwiftFormat rules (`hoistTry`, `wrapIfExpressionBodies`), the chat UI test switching user while the keyboard covered the tab bar, and the extended demo test checking a row it had scrolled past; all fixed
- Phase 3 was built in a Linux container with no Xcode. `swift test` ran there (Swift 6.1.3) over Core, Data and every Features file and test that does not import SwiftUI, including every view model. All SwiftUI code (views, components, `Theme`) and the UI tests were compiled and run only by GitHub Actions on `macos-26`, through pushes to the session branch; SwiftLint and SwiftFormat ran there too (`manual-checks.yml`). No screen of Phase 3 has been looked at by a person
- Not seen on screen by anyone: the profile, the gift card before and after redeeming, the chat, the review sheet, the review on Request Detail, the avatars in light and dark, and every new screen at the largest text sizes
- The chat composer and the review sheet have not been tried with the keyboard on a real device; UI tests type into them on the simulator
- Not yet checked by a person: the demo script has only been run by `DemoFlowUITests`, and VoiceOver labels were set in code and read back through UI tests, not listened to with VoiceOver on.
- The segmented radius and activity pickers do not grow with Dynamic Type. That is how the system control behaves; everything else was checked at the `accessibility-large` text size.
- The red error banner on Request Detail (shown when an action fails) has not been seen on screen; no test flow makes an action fail.
- On Request Detail the Location value wraps to two lines now that the row has a leading symbol.
- The plan asks for the demo script to be run by hand in light and dark at the end of 2C. An agent cannot; `DemoFlowUITests` ran it in light mode, and the screenshot test walks most of it in dark mode.
- At accessibility text sizes the Post location text wraps under its pin icon. That is how the system lays out a `Label` in a list at those sizes.
- Not seen on screen, because no test flow produces them: the Post submit error, the Post location error, and the My Activity load error.
- At the largest accessibility text size the Post title field cuts a long title with "…" while it is not being edited, and the tab bar labels stay small. Both are how the system controls behave.
- The app icon has only been seen as the generated image and through a successful build, not on a Home Screen.
- Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency were checked in light mode only.
- `ScreenshotUITests` takes about four minutes for its four passes. It is skipped in CI and in normal runs, where no screenshot folder is set.
- In `ScreenshotUITests`, wait for something near the top of the screen before a capture: at the large text size, rows below the fold do not exist yet and a wait on them fails.
- If dark-mode screenshots come out light, the simulator is stuck: `xcrun simctl shutdown` and `boot` it. This happened once on the iPhone 17 simulator, where even Settings stayed light.
- CI does not run SwiftLint or SwiftFormat; run them locally before pushing.
- A CI run takes about 12 minutes, nearly all of it the UI tests on the hosted simulator.
- The UI test suite takes a little over three minutes, mostly app launches and typing.
- If a UI test fails, `xcodebuild` can sit for several minutes collecting diagnostics before it exits.
- `xcodebuild` prints `appintentsmetadataprocessor ... Metadata extraction skipped` warnings. They come from an Xcode build tool, not the Swift compiler, and need no action.

## Open questions

- Phase 3: the helper can mark a request completed (Phase 1 rule 4), so a helper can award themselves 10 points. Default: leave it for the prototype; later, award points only when the requester confirms.
- Phase 3: are 10 points per favor, 2 per star and 100 points for a "$5" gift card the right values? Default: yes, as placeholders in `KindnessRules`.
- Phase 3: should chat stay open for sending after a request is completed? Default: no, the thread becomes read-only.
- Phase 3: what does someone else's profile show? Default: completed requests only, never gift-card progress or reward codes.
- Should 2D finish before 3A? Resolved 2026-10-09: yes, 2D was done first.
- Review gate after 2B. Resolved 2026-10-08: the repo owner looked at the Nearby and Request Detail screenshots and approved them as they are (teal brand, rounded-rectangle badges, pill-shaped action buttons). No palette or component changes were requested.
- Phase 2: is teal the right brand color, and who approves the look at the review gate after 2B? Defaults: teal, and the repo owner.
- 1B through 1G were each branched from the previous phase branch because the earlier pull requests were not merged yet. Resolved: no pull requests; `main` was fast-forwarded to the last phase branch, which contains the earlier ones.
- The plan's 1A says "first commit pushed to `main`", while `CLAUDE.md` says one branch per phase. Resolved as: the pre-existing docs were committed straight to `main`, and the 1A work is on `phase/1a-scaffold` for a pull request.
