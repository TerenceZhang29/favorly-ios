# Progress

Updated by every coding session. Read this after `docs/PLAN.md` and continue from the first unchecked item.

**Current phase:** 1B. Core domain
**Next task:** Add the models, enums, `FavorlyError` and service protocols from the plan's *Domain model* to `FavorlyCore`, replacing `FavorlyCoreModule`

## Phase checklist

- [x] **1A.** Repo scaffold and empty app
- [ ] **1B.** Core domain (models, protocols, rules, distance)
- [ ] **1C.** Mock data layer (repository, location, session, seed data)
- [ ] **1D.** App environment and navigation shell (tabs, Dev Settings)
- [ ] **1E.** Browse nearby + request detail + pick up (Flow 2)
- [ ] **1F.** Post request + My Activity (Flow 1)
- [ ] **1G.** Hardening, UI test, docs, tag `v0.1.0-prototype`

## Confirmed decisions

Defaults from the plan's Preparation section. Change here if the team decides otherwise.

- Bundle identifier: `edu.cornelltech.team402.favorly`
- Minimum iOS: 17
- Default fake location: Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island (40.7553, -73.9562)
- Categories: Ingredient, Moving help, Car help, Errand, Other
- Units: miles in the UI, meters internally

## Decisions made during implementation

Add entries as `YYYY-MM-DD · phase · decision · reason`.

- 2026-10-07 · 1A · The `Favorly` scheme's test action lists the three package test targets and `FavorlyUITests` directly, with no `.xctestplan` file · a test plan file refers to project targets by generated IDs, which would be hand-maintained against a git-ignored project; the scheme runs the same tests
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Optional GitHub Actions CI left out · it could not be verified from this machine, and the hosted runner's Xcode and simulator names are unknown; add it once someone can watch a run
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · `FavorlyCoreModule` and `FavorlyDataModule` are placeholder types so the targets compile and have one trivial test each · delete them in 1B and 1C when real types land
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Only folders that hold a file exist so far (`Root/` in Features) · git does not track empty folders; each later phase creates the plan's folders as it fills them
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · SwiftFormat rule `wrapPropertyBodies` disabled · the plan's own code uses one-line computed properties (`var id: RequestID { request.id }`)
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · SwiftLint `trailing_comma` set to mandatory · otherwise it conflicts with SwiftFormat, which adds trailing commas
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · UI test target has `LaunchUITests` (app shows four tabs) · the target needs a source file; `DemoFlowUITests` arrives in 1G
- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Tab bar buttons are found by label in UI tests (`app.tabBars.buttons["Nearby"]`) · SwiftUI does not reliably pass a tab item's `accessibilityIdentifier` to the tab bar button

## Known issues

- `xcodebuild` prints `appintentsmetadataprocessor ... Metadata extraction skipped` warnings. They come from an Xcode build tool, not the Swift compiler, and need no action.

## Open questions

- The plan's 1A says "first commit pushed to `main`", while `CLAUDE.md` says one branch per phase. Resolved as: the pre-existing docs were committed straight to `main`, and the 1A work is on `phase/1a-scaffold` for a pull request.

## Session log

Newest first, one line per session: `YYYY-MM-DD · phase · what was done · next step`.

- 2026-10-07 · 1A · Package with three library and three test targets, `project.yml`, app with four empty tabs, launch UI test, lint/format configs, README, ARCHITECTURE; `swift test` and `xcodebuild test` (iPhone 17, iOS 27.0) pass · start 1B on `phase/1b-core-domain`
